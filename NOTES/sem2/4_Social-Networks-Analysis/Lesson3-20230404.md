## Betweenness Centrality

## Problem
Consider a complete binary tree of L+1 levels. Where the root level is the zeroth level and the maximum level is L $0 \le l \le L$. Can you define a formula which will provide the Betweeness Centrality for each node at a given level.
$B(l, L) = ?$

Answer:
Let L=3
