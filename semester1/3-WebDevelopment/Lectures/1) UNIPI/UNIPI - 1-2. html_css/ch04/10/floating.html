      What is HTML?</div>

   <p>HTML is the lingua franca for publishing hypertext on the World Wide Web. 
It is a non-proprietary format based upon SGML, and can be created and processed 
by a wide range of tools, from simple plain text editors - you type it in from 
scratch- to sophisticated WYSIWYG authoring tools. HTML uses tags to structure text into headings, paragraphs, lists, hypertext 
links etc. </p>
