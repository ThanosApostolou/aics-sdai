                "description": "One of the top monuments to visit in Athens is the temple of Olympian Zeus. This grand temple was the dwelling place of the King of the Olympians in Greek antiquity, the building that housed his worshiping statue, not the gathering place of believers, as in the Christian world. The worshippers were gathered in the surrounding area outside the temple, where there was also an altar, for sacrifice and worship. Today, only 16 of the 104 original colossal columns survive but are enough to dominate the area and make you feel really small if you stand next to them. During the Roman times, the statue of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who was a great benefactor of Athens and was worshipped as a god by many, was placed in the temple as well. The remaining columns of the ancient monument create a spectacular view with the Acropolis and its monuments in the background.",
