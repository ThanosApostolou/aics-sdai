# Random Maze Generator and Pathfinding

## Description

This is a Unity implementation of a random maze generator and pathfinding algorithms such as A*. The maze is generated using a depth-first search algorithm that creates a random graph with a maze-like structure. The maze can be customized by changing the size, the starting and ending positions are randomly selected.

The program includes a visualization tool that displays the generated maze and the shortest path from the starting to the ending position. The path is calculated using the A* algorithm, which is a heuristic search algorithm that finds the optimal path between two points in a graph.

To run the program, simply clone the repository and open it in Unity. You can customize the parameters of the maze by editing the MazeGenerator script in the Scripts folder.

## Features

- Random maze generation with customizable size, random start and end positions
- A* pathfinding algorithm for finding the shortest path from start to end position
- Visualization tool that displays the maze and the optimal path
- Easy to use and customize

## Dependencies

Unity 2021.x or later
