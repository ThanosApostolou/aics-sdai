# This Python class provides fundamental computational functionality for the
# implementation of the encoder. In particular, the encoder will be composed of
# an embedding layer followed by a GRU layer. The input to the encoder is a
# sequence of integers, which is converted to a sequence of embedding vectors
# of size embedding_dim. This sequence of vectors is subsequently sent to an
# RNN, which converts the input at each of the timesteps_num timesteps to a
# vector of size encode_dim. Mind that only the output at the last time step
# is actually returned since the return_sequences parameter is set to False.
